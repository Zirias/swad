description:
%%name%% provides a http service for cookie authentication with a HTML login
form. The intended usage is to put it behind a reverse proxy that can do
sub-requests for authentication, like nginx' `auth_request` module.

It supports authentication methods using a username and a password as
credentials. For these, different credential checkers can be configured.

Login is offered for configurable realms, which have a name and a stack of
credential checkers. These checkers  are tried in the order they are
configured for the realm.
